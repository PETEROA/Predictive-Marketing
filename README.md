# Predictive-Marketing
This repository presents the implementation of a research article (Zaki et al. (2023)) focusing on the integration of predictive analytics and machine learning techniques for direct marketing strategies in the banking sector, specifically to forecast bank term deposit subscriptions. Leveraging datasets from Kaggle, the methodology encompasses data exploration, visualization, and the individual implementation of machine learning models such as SGD Classifier, k-nearest neighbor Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. Data obtained at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/bank-term-deposit-predictions.
